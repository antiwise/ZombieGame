hey
for that game
see if you can add items to pick up and throw that cause more damage
and see if you can make it a protector game where someone is hiding behind you
so you (the player) does not get hurt but the person u are protecting does

Opponents must attack more
 
Must be able to pick up and throw items that you pick up

-add damage meters to pickup objects???
-add 1 more weapon and 1 more stage

Michael says:
 i dont like that i can walk off screen
 there are not enough enemies
 how do i pick up items
throw
Michael says:
 what items can i pick up
 I dont see any
Michael says:
 I am not really being chased
 the barrel should project more on throw
 not quite ready for us to do character design yet
 bt if u polish it I will put an animator on it

YOU CAN PROBABLY FIX THE ZOMBIE BY ADJUSTING GETTING NEXTSQUARE OPTION
